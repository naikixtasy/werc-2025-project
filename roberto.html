    <p>
      My name is Roberto Moreno. I’m a 22-year-old currently studying Mechanical Engineering at New Mexico State University and I expect to graduate in Spring 2025. I am passionate about practical applications of engineering and contributing to projects that provide real-world environmental impact.

      As part of the WERC 2025 “Renewable Energy Solution for Water & Environmental Restoration” project, I served as the Filtration & CAD Specialist. My role included the design and optimization of the water purification system using natural media (sand, cotton, lava rock, coconut-activated charcoal, and gravel), and creating CAD models for both conceptualization and construction of the prototype. This hands-on project allowed me to apply engineering theory into practice while working collaboratively with a multidisciplinary team.
