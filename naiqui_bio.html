    <p><strong>Aspiring Aerospace and Mechanical Engineer | STEM Researcher | SHPE Board Officer</strong></p>

    <p>As a senior pursuing dual degrees in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at New Mexico State University (NMSU), I have cultivated a robust foundation in engineering principles, research methodologies, and leadership.</p>

    <p>My academic journey is complemented by active participation in programs such as the <a href="https://role.nmsu.edu/profiles/2022-2023-cohort.html" target="_blank">Research-Oriented Learning Experiences (ROLE)</a> program and the Aggie Innovation Space's Advanced Manufacturing Program (AMP), where I am progressing toward SolidWorks certification.</p>

    <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I serve on the board of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), contributing to initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion within STEM fields. My commitment to fostering representation is further demonstrated through my role as a SHPEtinas representative, where I support programs aimed at accelerating Latina leadership in STEM.</p>

    <p>My research experience includes conducting scientific investigations as part of the Aggie Innovation Space, focusing on advanced manufacturing techniques and their applications in aerospace engineering. Notably, I contributed to an experiment that was launched to the International Space Station, showcasing my ability to apply engineering concepts to real-world challenges.</p>

    <p>I am proficient in CAD modeling with SolidWorks, have experience with finite element analysis using ANSYS, and possess programming skills in Python and MATLAB. My goal is to leverage these skills to develop innovative solutions in aerospace technology and contribute to advancements in space exploration.</p>
