    <h2>Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering Senior / STEM Research / SHPE Board of officers</h2>
    <p class="location">Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States</p>
    <p>
      As an engineer, my curiosity about life, the world, and the universe drives me to use science not just as a tool, but as a language of love towards humanity. I aspire to apply my skills in aerospace and mechanical engineering to contribute to the well-being of our society and to advance toward my dream of becoming an astronaut and seeing the world from the stars. My greatest desire is to demonstrate that, in the end, there are more things that unite us than divide us, and that education and science can be powerful forces to build a better future for everyone.
