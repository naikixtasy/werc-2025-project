    <p><strong>Aspiring Aerospace & Mechanical Engineer | STEM Researcher | SHPE Board Officer</strong></p>

    <p>Iâ€™m currently completing dual degrees in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at New Mexico State University. My career is driven by a passion for space exploration, sustainable technologies, and advancing engineering for the betterment of humanity.</p>

    <p>I serve as the team lead for the WERC 2025 project, where I directed a multi-disciplinary team in the design and implementation of a wind-powered water filtration and soil monitoring system for wildfire recovery. This included work in systems design, electronics integration (Arduino & sensors), and real-time environmental data monitoring.</p>

    <p>With certifications in SolidWorks, CATIA, and hands-on training in ANSYS, Iâ€™ve also led research in microgravity with the RISE program, supported by NASA EPSCoR. I have over 10 years of experience in electronics repair and am the founder of a 3D printing lab focused on education and innovation.</p>

    <p>Fluent in technical and creative problem-solving, Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities in space systems, sustainable engineering, or research where I can contribute to meaningful change. My long-term goal is to become an astronaut and help expand human awareness through scientific discovery and ethical technology.</p>
