    <h1>Naiqui M. Armendariz</h1>
    <h3>Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering | Researcher | Project Lead</h3>

    <p>
      Naiqui Armendariz is a senior double majoring in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at New Mexico State University, with a professional focus on sustainable systems, additive manufacturing, and structural analysis. She combines over a decade of hands-on technical experience with strong leadership in research, design, and innovation.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an intern at <strong>Supernal</strong>, a Hyundai company developing advanced air mobility solutions, Naiqui contributed to the design and testing of electrical mounting systems and structural components for eVTOL aircraft. Her work included physical system prototyping, 3D modeling, and support in mounting integration using SolidWorks and CATIA.
    </p>

    <p>
      Naiqui is also the founder of <strong>Geekland 3D</strong>, a 3D printing business where she applies her skills in additive manufacturing, material science, and custom prototyping. Her specialization in <strong>structures and materials</strong> is backed by practical experience and academic focus in simulation and mechanical design.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the <strong>ROLE Program</strong>, she gained advanced skills in multidisciplinary research, team collaboration, data analysis, and rapid prototyping. Her research projects have included microgravity experiments for water purification using cactus mucilage, with a successful payload launched to the International Space Station through the NASA Student Spaceflight Experiments Program (SSEP).
    </p>

    <p>
      Her technical background includes:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CAD & Simulation</strong>: SolidWorks (Certified), CATIA (Certified), ANSYS</li>
        <li><strong>Programming</strong>: Python, Arduino (C/C++), ROS, MATLAB, Linux terminal</li>
        <li><strong>Systems</strong>: Electronics integration, real-time sensor data, IoT & Arduino deployment</li>
        <li><strong>Manufacturing</strong>: Additive manufacturing, FDM 3D printing, material testing, structural design</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Bilingual in English and Spanish and fluent in collaborative leadership, Naiqui is also a STEM advocate through SHPE and SHPEtinas. She actively mentors students and leads awareness projects blending technology and consciousness through ethical engineering and environmental design.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her long-term mission is to contribute to sustainable space exploration, promote inclusive innovation, and become an astronaut contributing to global progress through science, ethics, and exploration.
