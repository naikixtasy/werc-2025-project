    <h3>Engineering Physics | Water Testing & Field Operations</h3>

    <p>
      TJ Bell is an Engineering Physics major with a mechanical focus at New Mexico State University, set to graduate in May 2025. Originally from Farmington, New Mexico, TJ grew up with a deep connection to nature and the outdoors. This early appreciation continues to shape his passion for sustainability and innovation in engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of the WERC 2025 Capstone Team, TJ served as the <strong>Water Testing and Field Operations Specialist</strong>. He was responsible for managing water sample collection, performing turbidity and pH analysis, and monitoring soil and water conditions during real-time system evaluations. His strong foundation in physics brought scientific rigor and consistency to the experimental process.
    </p>

    <p>
      TJ played a crucial role in executing the team‚Äôs sustainable filtration strategy, contributing to prototype setup and field testing. His ability to work in dynamic environments and adapt quickly to technical challenges made him an essential asset throughout the project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though still refining his future career path, TJ is driven by a clear mission: to reduce wasteful engineering practices and design systems that benefit both people and the planet. He envisions a future where scientific knowledge is applied responsibly to protect all forms of life and improve global quality of life.
