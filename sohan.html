    <h2>Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering Student – Sensors & Data Specialist</h2>
    <p class="location">New Mexico State University | Class of 2025</p>

    <p>
      I’m a first-generation Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering student graduating in May 2025 with a strong focus on manufacturing processes and innovation. I'm actively involved in Alpha Tau Omega (ATO) and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), where I’ve built a deep appreciation for communication, adaptability, and teamwork.

    <p>
      For the WERC 2025 Environmental Design Contest, I contributed as the **Sensors & Data Analyst**. I was responsible for implementing the system’s environmental monitoring components, including the setup and calibration of capacitive soil moisture sensors, real-time data logging via ESP8266 modules, and interfacing with the Arduino system for wireless tracking and analysis. This experience strengthened my embedded systems knowledge and showed me how sustainability and data can work together to solve real-world problems.
